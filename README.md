# Course Assignment 2 - Merging test and training data to create a tidy data set

## Following are the goals of the assignment

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


###The above goal can achieved by running the 'run_analysis.R' script which is available in the current repo

## Key instructions to execute the run_analysis.R script
1. Download the zip file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to your working folder
2. Extract the zip file to you working directory, the '"UCI HAR Dataset"' directory and its sub-directories with the required files will be created.
3. download the '"run_analysis.R"' to the directory of you choice
4. At R-prompt use command source(```<<your-file-path>>/run_analysis.R```)
5. A file named ```tidyData.txt``` will be created in you working directory
