# Course Assignment 2 - Merging test and training data to create a tidy data set

My goal is to collect and clean data from the files located at this url
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

For the purpose of this assignment, the zip file is pre-downloaded and extracted to the following folder
"UCI HAR Dataset"

This folder should be available in the working directory of your R system or R Studio

The script works with the following files

UCI HAR Dataset\activity_labels.txt  
UCI HAR Dataset\features.txt

UCI HAR Dataset\test\y_test.txt
UCI HAR Dataset\test\X_test.txt
UCI HAR Dataset\test\subject_test.txt

UCI HAR Dataset\train\y_train.txt
UCI HAR Dataset\train\X_train.txt
UCI HAR Dataset\train\subject_train.txt
